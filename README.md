# Summer-2023-Projects
Goal for this summer is to learn Python to prepare myself for research in the fall.
These projects are learning opportunities for me in a language I am not the most familiar with.
As you can see, computational linguistics is a passion of mine. I love working with language and computers!

## Larger projects (_not_ contained in this repo)

### [Conlang Tools](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Conlang-Tools)

Some fun tools I developed to help in my hobby of creating conlangs (constructed languages).

### [Phylogenetic Interference w/ PMI Exploration](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Phylogenetic-Interference-PMI)

An exploration/replication of a research paper exploring using Pointwise Mutual Information to compute distances between languages using wordlists (minimize subjective input and previous work).

### [Minimal Naming Game](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Minimal-Naming-Game)

Simple simulation of how language develops in a group.

### [Melvin Voice Synthesizer](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Melvin-Voice-Synthesizer)

Fun tool to synthesize my voice using clips of IPA sounds. Takes input IPA transcription and outputs/saves file of myself saying it. 

### [UMD.io-Console](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/UMD.io-Console)

Tool for gathering information about classes, majors, schedules, etc. at UMD, as well as a way for students to make schedules for the upcoming semesters. TBD: Allow for users to create custom schedule times, for things like research, TAing, etc.  

### [Lexicon Modeling Simulator](https://github.com/rmhopkins4/Lexicon-Modeling-Simulator)

Simulates the evolution of communication in populations. Based on a research paper comparing different structures of communication between agents.
